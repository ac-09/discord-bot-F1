# discord-bot-F1

This bot automatically updates its own message(s) in a dedicated text channel to show the next F1 session, the next qualifying/race events, the current drivers' and constructors' standings and the most recent qualifying/sprint/race classification.

The standings and classification comes from the Ergast API and the session times are from a copy of the Ergast database.
